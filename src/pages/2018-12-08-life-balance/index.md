I have been working for almost 4 years in Dublin as
a software engineer and like many other jobs, it's not
good to be a workaholic (and I am not), but even though
is good to keep some healthy habits.

### Do sport

There is no excuse... Everybody can do sport at its own
level and it's good for the mind.  
Especially when I am going through stressful periods, sport
is something that gratifies you and frees your mind from
job's thoughts.

### Take vitamin D

After some years I got used to Dublin's weather and temperature,
but during winter we get a lot less sunlight.
Using a vitamin D integrator (I use cod liver oil) helps you to
stay resilient and positive.
I have no medical knowledge... but I notice the effects of it
after a few days of assumption.

### Build awareness around your time connected

At work we build a sort of automatic reactivity to online events:
* Slack notifications
* Email
* Meetings

When we are back in normal life we should put effort to stay more
connected to the people that are with us, rather to the ones that
notify our phones.

### Check your alcohol assumption

It's important to socialize and also to have a well-deserved pint
after a week of hard work.  
It is a very usual habit here in Dublin and I believe that like
with all the things, it's healthy to keep a balance.
Alcohol can affect your sleep time and focus and also exaggerating
on Friday's drink might preserve you to do something different in 
the only days that you are free.

### Build happiness

There are many well paid IT job roles in Dublin and it's important
to remember that you are also here in Dublin to enjoy your time.
It's important to be paid fairly, but also working for a company
that respects your time off.  
Check [jobs' reviews](https://www.glassdoor.ie) on Glassdoor to
have an idea about what people say and looking for.
If you keep complaining about this topic, take some time to consider
what to change.
